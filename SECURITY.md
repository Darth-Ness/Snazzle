# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support just the latest `release-x.y` branch and its `release-x.y.z` versions, so you're always going to want to update your Snazzle to the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vuln, create an issue and tag it with `vuln` and a severity level. We'll base how we respond to it on the severity level.
